          This AMA Lounge will provide comprehensive daily news sources from
          start-up projects on the network and beyond.
        </p>

          The-labz.com unites the XRPL and BSC community, creating an innovative
          approach to AMA (Ask Me Anything) lounges duly named{" "}

          .
        </p>
        <p>
          The AMA lounge endeavours to provide its listeners and viewers with
          updates in the blockchain, Web3 and crypto space as well as hosting
          live AMA sessions with new project founders.
        </p>
        <p>
          The creation of the lounge will be a collaborative pursuit with
          shibanft.co.uk, an NFT ecosystem platform based on the XRP ledger,
          which has network access to a multitude of tier 1 athletes, musicians,
          influencers, and entrepreneurs such as James Rule, Jennifer Arcuri,
          Vix Smith, and Perry Parker as well as Web3 / blockchain-based
          projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          ShibaNFT has recently announced its collaboration with The Labz, a
          Web3 ecosystem builder platform specialising in the creation and
          deployment of innovative Web3 technologies, blockchain-focused
          architecture venture activities, and holistic DeFi technical
          consultancy. free
        </p>
        <p>
          The Chief Executive Officer of The Labz commented, “The Labz team is
          excited to collaborate on creating the pioneering AMA lounge for the
          XRPL community and all other network communities. This is a step
          forward in the mass adoption challenge and amalgamating communities
          alongside exposing start-up project founders to new network
          opportunities”.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, to the announcement of the AMA lounge going live, there
          will be two planned NFT collections in the coming weeks. These NFT
          collections will be free for users to mint, with the utility providing
          holders with access to technological and business development
          advancements held by The Labz.
        </p>
        <p>
          The two collections will showcase two types of aesthetics with various
          traits. One of the NFT collections will present a nutty professor for
          the BSC community. Following the release of the initial NFT
          collection, the second collection will be a re-design of the initial
          NFTs fused with the famous ShibaNFT dog from XRPL.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, the question arises: “what makes the Incubator Hub AMA lounge
          different from other AMA lounges?”
        </p>
        <p>
          AMA lounges currently run on a linear relationship with their guests.
          Once the AMA has been conducted, there is typically a limited
          relationship between the lounge and the guest.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Incubator Hub endeavours to reinvent the wheel and approach AMA’s
          in a new manner. With the plethora of network access within the Web3
          and traditional business space alongside a robust delivery network
          that is well-versed in a multitude of technology stacks and
          blockchain, AMA guests (project founders) will be able to opt for a
          holistic end-to-end blockchain architecture framework which spans from
          being introduced to tier 1/2/3 VC firms, Web3 product ecosystem
          development and ensuring the products within the project’s ecosystem
          are VC ready and market ready.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>THE ROADMAP</strong> <br /> Part 2 of the roadmap includes An
          NFT collection with incredible utility, which will benefit Projects
          and NFT holders alike in a way that&#39;s never before been achieved
          on either blockchain.
        </p>
        <p>
          More information on this collection will be made public in December in
          anticipation of its launch on January the 1st in anticipation of new
          year's resolutions.
